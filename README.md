# Android Application Structure
Some of the frameworks/libraries being used by SkillCourt are
#### Adapters
>This folder contains all the classes you will use to show lists or options. Right now only contains GamesPlayedRecyclerViewAdapter which you can find on the main dashboard screen.
#### Connection
>Connection contains all the classes related to our wifi connection to our Arduinos. We have a manager that handle each ArduinoConnectionHandler using an Arduino object. All of these belongs to the project. There is no use of a library for this.
#### Entities
>All the classes related to our business logic
#### Game
>This folder contains all the classes used during a game. We have the CountDownTimer class which is the timer. We also have an SkillCourtManager used to handle all the games created while using the application
#### Interfaces
>Creation of java interfaces used all over the application
#### Manager
>Contains the StepManager, which handles the configuration of the dynamic steps
#### IU
>This folder contains all of the UI classes from android. It contains the Activities and Fragments divided by functionality.

**Structure:** these are libraries embedded in the project.  No need to change them unless we have to update to the latest libraries.


# Firebase
For the android application and storing data, we are using a firebase application.  To learn more about FireBase you can visit them at https://firebase.google.com/docs/ .  The library is embedded within the app and does not need to be updated unless the database structure has been changed.
